## Titel: Evaluation of Snow Depth Retrievals from Differences in ICESat-2 and CryoSat-2 Freeboards Using In-Situ Measurements in the Weddell Sea

**Abstract.** Snow on Antarctic sea ice remains poorly understood, primarily due to a lack of comprehensive data. Snow significantly impacts sea ice by preventing its growth in winter and melting in summer, thanks to its high albedo and insulating properties. Obtaining accurate data on snow depth is crucial for better understanding these processes. Satellite data offers a promising method for obtaining extensive time series over large areas, but its accuracy compared to in-situ measurements is uncertain. This research evaluates snow depth retrievals using lidar data from ICESat-2 and radar data from CryoSat-2, comparing them to in-situ snow accumulation measurements from Snow Buoys drifting in the Weddell Sea. The statistical analysis, primarily conducted using Python, focuses on differences between the satellite snow product and snow depth from a simple 1-D thermodynamic model driven by snow accumulation rates from the Snow Buoys. Additionally, auxiliary datasets such as sea ice age and concentration are used for intercomparisons for consistency. Results show that the in-situ data and satellite products have temporal and spatial overlaps, allowing for comparison. However, the daily retrieved snow depth derived from the freeboards from ICESat-2 and CryoSat-2 consistently underestimated the snow depth from the buoys, corrected by a simple 1-D thermodynamic model. Further, the relative changes of the two snow depth products were examined, examining how much snow was added and lost. For future work, it is suggested that the SNOWPACK model be used to correct the snow accumulation from the Snow Buoys, as it considers not only the formation of snow ice but also the formation of superimposed ice.
