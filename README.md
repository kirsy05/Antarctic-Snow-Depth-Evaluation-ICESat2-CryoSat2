## Titel: Evaluation of Snow Depth Retrievals from Differences in ICESat-2 and CryoSat-2 Freeboards Using In-Situ Measurements in the Weddell Sea

**Abstract.** Snow on Antarctic sea ice remains poorly understood, primarily due to a lack of comprehensive data. Snow significantly impacts sea ice by preventing its growth in winter and melting in summer, thanks to its high albedo and insulating properties. Obtaining accurate data on snow depth is crucial for better understanding these processes. Satellite data offers a promising method for obtaining extensive time series over large areas, but its accuracy compared to in-situ measurements is uncertain. This study aims to evaluate snow depth retrievals using lidar data from ICESat-2 and radar data from CryoSat-2, comparing them to in-situ snow accumulation measurements from Snow Buoys drifting in the Weddell Sea. The statistical analysis, primarily conducted using Python, focuses on differences between the satellite snow product and snow depth from a simple 1-D thermodynamic model driven by snow accumulation rates from the Snow Buoys. Additionally, auxiliary datasets such as multiyear ice concentration and sea ice concentration are used for intercomparisons for consistency. Results showed that the daily snow depths derived from the freeboards from ICESat-2 and CryoSat-2 consistently underestimated the snow depth from the buoys corrected by a simple 1-D thermodynamic model by an average of 45 cm. This can be caused by the limited penetration depth of the radar signal, error in the simple snow model to correct the buoy data for snow ice processes or the spatial and temporal difference of the two snow depth products. This study showed that there are 29 temporal and spatial overlaps between the two data products, but we have to keep in mind that the satellite product is an average over the grid cell, whereas the Snow Buoy gives us a point measurement. However, despite these limitations, the temporal evolution of snow depth between the satellite product and Snow Buoy 2021S114 in 2021 showed promising alignment when both measured snow depth over first-year ice. Moreover, the spatio-temporal snow depth gradients of the satellite-buoy pair of 2021S114 in the year 2021 aligned almost perfectly. This highlights the need for further research, particularly through deploying more Snow Buoys on first-year ice floes. Although there were only a limited number of matches between the satellite and buoy data, overall there were already some promising results that highlight the need for future research in this area. Furthermore, for future work, the SNOWPACK model is suggested to correct the snow accumulation from the Snow Buoys, as it considers not only the formation of snow ice but also the formation of superimposed ice.
